                In October, US Federal Reserve continue to cut the policy rate by 25 bps in line with
                consensus expectations. However, the Federal Reserve Governor statements post
                policy were hawkish. Other Central Banks like ECB, BoE and BoJ kept the policy rate
                unchanged and reiterated to remain data-dependent.

                After raising rates sharply since March 2022, US Fed raised the policy rate by 25 bps
                to 5.25% (total hike in cycle: 500 bps). From being aggressive, Fed Governor indicated
                that further rate action will be data dependent. With real policy rate (policy rate
                adjusted against 1 year ahead inflation projections) at 2%, the real rates were already
                in restrictive zone. This along with lag impact of cumulative rate hikes till date,
                financial stability issues would help in keeping credit conditions tight and thereby
                help in bringing down inflation over time.
